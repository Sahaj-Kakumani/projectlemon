    <!--History-->
    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>
      The origin of the lemon is unknown, though lemons are thought to have
      first grown in Assam (a region in northeast India), northern Burma or
      China.A genomic study of the lemon indicated it was a hybrid between
      bitter orange (sour orange) and citron.Lemons entered Europe near southern
      Italy no later than the second century AD, during the time of Ancient
      Rome.However, they were not widely cultivated. They were later introduced
      to Persia and then to Iraq and Egypt around 700 AD.The lemon was first
      recorded in literature in a 10th-century Arabic treatise on farming, and
      was also used as an ornamental plant in early Islamic gardens.It was
      distributed widely throughout the Arab world and the Mediterranean region
      between 1000 and 1150.An article on Lemon and lime tree cultivation in
      Andalusia of Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century
      agricultural work, Book on Agriculture.The first substantial cultivation
      of lemons in Europe began in Genoa in the middle of the 15th century. The
      lemon was later introduced to the Americas in 1493 when Christopher
      Columbus brought lemon seeds to Hispaniola on his voyages. Spanish
      conquest throughout the New World helped spread lemon seeds. It was mainly
      used as an ornamental plant and for medicine.In the 19th century, lemons
      were increasingly planted in Florida and California.In 1747, James Lind's
      experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to
      their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known as an important dietary
      ingredient.The origin of the word lemon may be Middle Eastern.[2] The word
      draws from the Old French limon, then Italian limone, from the Arabic
      laymūn or līmūn, and from the Persian līmūn, a generic term for citrus
      fruit, which is a cognate of Sanskrit (nimbū, “lime”).

    <!--Varieties-->
    <h2 id="varieties">Varieties</h2>
    <p>
      The 'Bonnie Brae' is oblong, smooth, thin-skinned and seedless. These are
      mostly grown in San Diego County, USA. The 'Eureka' grows year-round and
      abundantly. This is the common supermarket lemon, also known as 'Four
      Seasons' (Quatre Saisons) because of its ability to produce fruit and
      flowers together throughout the year. This variety is also available as a
      plant to domestic customers.There is also a pink-fleshed Eureka lemon,
      with a green and yellow variegated outer skin.The Lisbon lemon is very
      similar to the Eureka and is the other common supermarket lemon. It is
      smoother than the Eureka, has thinner skin, and has fewer or no seeds. It
      generally produces more juice than the Eureka.The 'Femminello St. Teresa',
      or 'Sorrento' is native to Italy. This fruit's zest is high in lemon oils.
      It is the variety traditionally used in the making of limoncello. The 'Yen
      Ben' is an Australasian cultivar.

    <!--Nutrition and phytochemicals-->
    <h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition and phytochemicals</h2>
    <p>
      Lemon is a rich source of vitamin C, providing 64% of the Daily Value in a
      100 g reference amount (table). Other essential nutrients are low in
      content. Lemons contain numerous phytochemicals, including polyphenols,
      terpenes, and tannins.Lemon juice contains slightly more citric acid than
      lime juice (about 47 g/l), nearly twice the citric acid of grapefruit
      juice, and about five times the amount of citric acid found in orange
      juice.
    </p>

    <!--Culinary uses-->
    <h2 id="culinary-use">Culinary uses</h2>
    <p>
      Lemon juice, rind, and peel are used in a wide variety of foods and
      drinks. The whole lemon is used to make marmalade, lemon curd and lemon
      liqueur. Lemon slices and lemon rind are used as a garnish for food and
      drinks. Lemon zest, the grated outer rind of the fruit, is used to add
      flavor to baked goods, puddings, rice, and other dishes.
    </p>

    <!--1.Juice-->
    <h3 id="culinary-juice">Juice</h3>
    <p>
      Lemon juice is used to make lemonade, soft drinks, and cocktails. It is
      used in marinades for fish, where its acid neutralizes amines in fish by
      converting them into nonvolatile ammonium salts. In meat, the acid
      partially hydrolyzes tough collagen fibers, tenderizing it.In the United
      Kingdom, lemon juice is frequently added to pancakes, especially on Shrove
      Tuesday. Lemon juice is also used as a short-term preservative on certain
      foods that tend to oxidize and turn brown after being sliced (enzymatic
      browning), such as apples, bananas, and avocados, where its acid denatures
      the enzymes.
    </p>

    <!--2.Peel-->
    <h3 id="culinary-peel">Peel</h3>
    <p>
      In Morocco, lemons are preserved in jars or barrels of salt. The salt
      penetrates the peel and rind, softening them, and curing them so that they
      last almost indefinitely.The preserved lemon is used in a wide variety of
      dishes. Preserved lemons can also be found in Sicilian, Italian, Greek,
      and French dishes. The peel can be used in the manufacture of pectin, a
      polysaccharide used as a gelling agent and stabilizer in food and other
      products.
    </p>

    <!--3.Oil-->
    <h3 id="culinary-oil">Oil</h3>
    <p>
      Lemon oil is extracted from oil-containing cells in the skin. A machine
      breaks up the cells, and uses a water spray to flush off the oil. The
      oil/water mixture is then filtered and separated by centrifugation.
    </p>

    <!--4.Leaves-->
    <h3 id="culinary-leaves">Leaves</h3>
    <p>
      The leaves of the lemon tree are used to make a tea and for preparing
      cooked meats and seafoods.
    </p>

    <!--Other uses-->
    <h2 id="Other">Other uses</h3>
    
    <h3>Industrial</h3>
    <p>
      Lemons were the primary commercial source of citric acid before the 
      development of fermentation-based processes.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Aroma</h3>
    <p>Lemon oil may be used in aromatherapy. Lemon oil aroma does not 
      influence the human immune system,but may contribute to relaxation.
    </p>

    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>
      One educational science experiment involves attaching electrodes 
      to a lemon and using it as a battery to produce electricity. 
      Although very low power, several lemon batteries can power a small 
      digital watch.These experiments also work with other fruits and vegetables.
      Lemon juice may be used as a simple invisible ink, developed by heat.
      Lemon juice can be used to increase the blonde colour of hair, acting 
      as a natural highlight after the moistened hair is exposed to sunlight. 
      This is due to the citric acid that acts as bleach.</p>
